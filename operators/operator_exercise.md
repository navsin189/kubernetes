That’s a great way to deepen your Kubernetes knowledge! Here’s an exercise for you to practice Kubernetes operators using the ClickHouse operator.

### **Exercise: Deploy and Manage ClickHouse with an Operator**
#### **Objective**
Use the ClickHouse operator to deploy a ClickHouse cluster, configure replication, and perform basic operations like scaling and backup.

#### **Steps**
1. **Set Up ClickHouse Operator**
   - Deploy the ClickHouse operator in your Kubernetes cluster.
   - Verify that the operator is running.

2. **Deploy a ClickHouse Cluster**
   - Define a `ClickHouseInstallation` (CHI) manifest to deploy a ClickHouse cluster with:
     - At least **2 shards** and **2 replicas per shard**.
     - Persistent storage.

3. **Test Replication**
   - Deploy a test table with replication enabled.
   - Insert data and verify that it is replicated across nodes.

4. **Scale the Cluster**
   - Increase the number of replicas per shard dynamically using an updated CHI manifest.
   - Verify the new replicas are added successfully.

5. **Backup and Restore**
   - Configure ClickHouse Keeper (or Zookeeper) for metadata backup.
   - Take a snapshot of the database.
   - Restore the data from the snapshot.

6. **Monitor and Troubleshoot**
   - Use `kubectl logs` and `kubectl get pods` to check the operator’s behavior.
   - Investigate how the operator handles failures (e.g., deleting a pod and seeing if it recovers).

#### **Bonus Challenge**
- **Automate the deployment**: Write a Helm chart or Kustomize template for your ClickHouse deployment.
- **Integrate with Prometheus & Grafana**: Enable monitoring for ClickHouse and visualize metrics.
